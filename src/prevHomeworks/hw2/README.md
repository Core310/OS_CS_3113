# Homework 2
## Files Provided
- HW2 folder, containing the following files to run the program:
    - hw2.c
    - hw2.h
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - README.md
- OS HW3.pdf, Homework PDF that was assigned in class. 

### Code
Program to create 10 threads, where each updates a shared variable by 1000. 

A print statement was provided but may be commented out if it does not fit the project requirements.

#### Building and running 
1) Build using `/home/cs053/CS3203/cmake-build-debug/CMAKE_C_STANDARD` on VM, 
or with `/"pathTo_cmake-build-debug/CMAKE_C_STANDARD"` configured to run hw2.c with CMakeLists.txt

#### Analysis: 
Code is written in C, and uses the pthread library to create threads.
